## Overview
The Auction Platform is a web-based application that allows users to participate in online auctions. The platform enables users to browse auctions, place bids, and manage their auction activity seamlessly.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration system.
- **Auction Management**: Users can create, browse, and manage auctions.
- **Bidding System**: Real-time bidding updates and notifications.
- **Responsive UI**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile users.
- **Performance Optimizations**: Fast and scalable backend with MongoDB.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React.js, Vite
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS

## Improvements Implemented
